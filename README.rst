IRMA Ansible Provisioning
=========================

|build-status| |docs|

IRMA platform is easily installed thanks to a set of `ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`_ roles and playbooks. It will allow you to build, install or maintain different setups.

- First, clone this repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/quarkslab/irma-ansible

There are 3 different types of IRMA setup:

- `Testing IRMA, the easiest way`_ (everything in one vm)
- `Production environment <docs/install_prod.rst>`_ (install on physical servers)
- `Development environment <docs/install_dev.rst>`_ (everything in one vm with sources rsync'd between host and vm)

Common requirements
-------------------

- `Ansible <http://www.ansible.com>`_ 1.8 or higher;

Dependencies are available via `Ansible Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com/>`_ repository. Installation has been made easy using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ansible-galaxy install -r ansible-requirements.yml # --force if you’ve already installed it

Testing IRMA, the easiest way
-----------------------------

Everything will be installed in the same virtual machine named `brain.irma`.

Requirements
````````````

- `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com/>`_ 1.8 or higher has to be installed. You
  should have the following plugins too:
    - `vagrant-hostmanager <https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager>`
- As the installation work only for `Virtualbox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_,
  you’ll need to install it

Setup
`````

Simply run in the `Vagrantfile` directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vagrant up


Vagrant will launch a VM and install IRMA on it. It can take a while
(from 15 to 30 min) depending on the amount of RAM you have on your computer
and the hard disk drive I/O speed.

IRMA allinone interface is available at `http://172.16.1.30 <http://172.16.1.30>`_.

Note: The basebox used in this project is provided by Quarkslab. The code
source to build it is `here <https://github.com/quarkslab/debian-vm>`_.


Useful commands
```````````````

some useful commands with vagrant:


.. code-block:: bash

    $ vagrant ssh brain.irma       # login through ssh
    $ vagrant halt brain.irma      # shutdown the machine
    $ vagrant reload brain.irma    # restart the machine
    $ vagrant up brain.irma        # start the machine
    $ vagrant destroy brain.irma   # delete the machine

for advanced usage of vagrant be sure to check `extras <docs/install_extras.rst>`_

Experimental support for Windows provisioning
=============================================

Generate Windows base box
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/boxcutter/windows
    $ cd windows
    $ make virtualbox/eval-win8x64-enterprise

Adding to Vagrant boxes
-----------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vagrant box add --name eval-win8x64-enterprise box/virtualbox/eval-win8x64-enterprise*.box

Creating an instance of the base box
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ vagrant up

Provisioning with ansible
-------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo pip install pywinrm
    $ ansible-playbook -i inventory playbooks/playbook.yml -u vagrant -k
