module: win_file
version_added: "1.8"
short_description: Creates, touches or removes files or directories.
extends_documentation_fragment: files
description:
     - Creates (empty) files, updates file modification stamps of existing files,
       and can create or remove directories.
       Unlike M(file), does not modify ownership, permissions or manipulate links.
notes:
    - See also M(win_copy), M(win_template), M(copy), M(template), M(assemble)
requirements: [ ]
author: Michael DeHaan
options:
  path:
    description:
      - 'path to the file being managed.  Aliases: I(dest), I(name)'
    required: true
    default: []
    aliases: ['dest', 'name']
  state:
    description:
      - If C(directory), all immediate subdirectories will be created if they
        do not exist.
        If C(file), the file will NOT be created if it does not exist, see the M(copy)
        or M(template) module if you want that behavior.  If C(absent),
        directories will be recursively deleted, and files will be removed.
        If C(touch), an empty file will be created if the c(path) does not
        exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and
        modification times (similar to the way `touch` works from the command line).
    required: false
    default: file
    choices: [ file, directory, touch, absent ]

# create a file
- win_file: path=C:\\temp\\foo.conf 

# touch a file (creates if not present, updates modification time if present)
- win_file: path=C:\\temp\\foo.conf state=touch 

# remove a file, if present
- win_file: path=C:\\temp\\foo.conf state=absent

# create directory structure
- win_file: path=C:\\temp\\folder\\subfolder state=directory

# remove directory structure
- win_file: path=C:\\temp state=absent
